\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The work on my doctorate began just about the time the internet became known to the general public (i.e. a long time ago).  The world wide web was an empty, slow, and boring place visited using Mosaic.  So this project has outlasted Mosaic, Netscape, and many other browsers.  It has outlasted the space shuttle, my mother, floppy disks, and Michael Jackson.  In fact the pursuit of this degree has even outlasted itself, as my original work (which at least led to a few papers) was abandoned about 10 years ago; the work presented within this document is the fruit of an entire second proposal, preliminary exam, and experimental effort.  But I became who I am today, learned almost everything I know today, and aside from my family have met everyone I care about through my extended studies and professional work at Virginia Tech.  Anything I do will be based on the sum of that experience.  I am better for the effort.

None of this would have been possible without the lifetime of support from my parents, Terry and Darla, to whom I literally owe everything.  In addition, my dad and I have both managed to marry into fantastic extended families, and Judy, Jeff, and Betty have all welcomed me as one of their own.  I have lucked out on many fronts, no questions about that.  I have had the support of my sister, aunts, uncles, cousins, and nephews and nieces all along.  With so much good behind you it is difficult to go wrong.

Much support also came my way through an adopted family, the VPI Cave Club (except of course that I adopted them and they have had to accept me, like-it-or-not).  I met my wife here along with many of my best friends, and from the oldest surviving members down to the most recent trainees, I simply say to all of you a collective thank-you.  I owe my life to more than one, but particularly need to thank Steve Wells for letting me fly and keeping me grounded at the same time.

I would like to thank the members and staff at the Blacksburg Volunteer Rescue Squad.  My time at the squad has been a valuable learning experience; more has been given to me than can ever be re-payed.  I am proud to be considered part of the crew.

No amount of thanks would be enough to pay back the day-to-day support extended by everyone in the ME shop, the always under-appreciated IT staff, and all the departmental office personnel - past and current.  It's been a long journey, so an especially hearty nod to those that have been with me all the way.

The most significant aspect of this work is not what is within this document, but what I gained while working on this document.  That brings me to the proper acknowledgement of my fellows.  There are so many that have worked beside me in the lab, supporting me and encouraging me through even the worst disasters that I cannot list them all; listing any would be a disservice to those I would forget.  From among what could have just been co-workers I have gained many friends over the years.  I owe every one of you.

Due to the lengthy time I've been at this, I've taken advantage of just about all the ME faculty for advice, classwork, and sometimes simply carrying something down the hall.  In particular I must thank my committee, and though it has been reworked numerous times, every member has contributed to my personal and professional development.  All, prior and current, have guided me to this point, and this work is so much better for the input gained by having such a robust group with which to work.  Thanks to everyone, and in particular my final committee members who helped see this through to the end.

No member of the committee has been a stronger supporter of my work than my advisor and personal friend Dr. Uri Vandsburger.  Few bosses, advisors, friends, or humans can claim to be a better person than Uri, and I am proud to have his name associated with mine anywhere.  It's been a long journey, the kind that cannot be undertaken without great support, and I count myself lucky to have found such a person to help me along.

Last I leave my greatest acknowledgement to the love of my life, my brilliant friend, lover, companion, and wife Alison, who has somehow tolerated me throughout every up, down, and twist of this entire process.  I could not and would not have done this without you.
