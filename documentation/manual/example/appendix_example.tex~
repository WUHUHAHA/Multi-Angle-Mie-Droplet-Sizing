\chapter{Example - Optical Method for Planar Measurement of Spray Characteristics}
\label{step_by_step_example}

The following sections present a step-by-step, Matlab-command-specific example of the entire multi-angle Mie scatting sizing method.  It will be assumed that Matlab is installed an working.  In addition, the example is executed using the linux version of Matlab; a few unix-specific commands are necessary within the sizing routines however it should be straightforward for a Windows user to make appropriate changes in these few cases.  Interested Windows users should contact the author; addition of a Windows-specific tree or improved coding allowing unrestricted use on both platforms would be welcomed.

\section{Get the Code}
\subsection{Downloading the Code}
The Matlab routines necessary to implement the ``Multi-Angle-Mie-Sizing'' method are hosted at:

https://github.com/leperas/Multi-Angle-Mie-Droplet-Sizing

The version directly referenced within the current work is denoted as Version 1, or v1 and is found in the download section.  

Additionally, the actual github repository is where the latest updates, capabilities, and new versions will be found.  The README within that repository should contain the most updated information about the project.

\subsection{Installing the Code}
Installation instructions are part of the code download, contained in the file README.install.  The most up-to-date install and configuration information will be maintained within that file.

\subsection{Contributing to the Code}
Currently documentation consists of this dissertation and the comments within the code.  Users interested in contributing new or improved code or documentation should start by installing \textbf{git} and then getting the latest software from https://github.com/leperas/Multi-Angle-Mie-Droplet-Sizing.  Contact the author in order to coordinate efforts.
