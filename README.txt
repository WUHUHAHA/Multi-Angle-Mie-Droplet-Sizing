Welcome to the Multi-Angle Mie Sizing project.

These Matlab routines are an important part of an optical droplet measurement system based on planar multi-angle Mie scattering.  Sizing information consists of a mean droplet diameter and droplet distribution estimates for every individual point within a planar area of interest.  The planar method makes possible the fast acquisition of data within a large field of interest, and uses relatively inexpensive instrumentation. 

Currently, the method has demonstrated the ability to measure water droplets from a typical simplex spray nozzle, across the range of 5-50$\mu$m within +/-10\% of known values, and in addition return an estimate of the shape and width of the size distribution at each location within the planar region of interest.  Measurements were successfully completed for three separate flow rate spray nozzles; 1-gallon-per-hour, 2.5-gallon-per-hour, and 4.5-gallon-per-hour.

Additionally the limits of the technique have been explored with simulated data.  Conclusions from these exercises show that the multi-angle planar Mie scatter method is capable of measuring droplet distribution characteristics and means within a nominal range of 0.3$\mu$m up to 150$\mu$m.

I am not a programmer, but I wrote these Matlab routines as part of my phd project; suggestions and improvements are welcome.

All the files referenced within the dissertation are contained within multi-angle-mie-sizing_v1.tar.bz2.  Download this file to it's own directory and run:

tar -jxf multi-angle-mie-sizing_v1.tar.bz2

Additional installation instructions are found within README.install.

Documentation currently consists of reading my dissertation - sorry about that.  But there is a complete HOWTO step-by-step example in the Appendix.

Thanks for you iterest.
